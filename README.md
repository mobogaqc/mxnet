Features
--------
* To Mix and Maximize
  - Mix all flavors of programming models to maximize flexiblity and efficiency.
* Lightweight and scalable
  - Minimum build dependency, scales to multi-GPU and ready toward distributed.
* Auto parallelization
  - Write numpy-style ndarray GPU programs, which will be automatically parallelized.
* Language agnostic
  - With support for python, c++, more to come.
* Cloud friendly
  - Directly load/save from S3, HDFS, AZure
* Easy extensibility
  - Extending no requirement on GPU programming.
