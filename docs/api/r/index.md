# MXNet - R API

MXNet supports the R programming language. The MXNet R package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to R. It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in R. It also lets you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in R,
  and apply them to tasks, such as image classification and data science challenges.

We are working on the MXNet for R API interface documentation. Until it's available, see the following resource to get started.
