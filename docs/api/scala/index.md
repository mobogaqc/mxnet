# MXNet - Scala API

MXNet supports the Scala programming language. The MXNet Scala package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to Scala. It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Scala. It also lets you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Scala,
  and apply them to tasks, such as image classification and data science challenges.

We are working on documentation for the MXNet for Scala API interface. Until it is available, see the following resources to get started.
