# MXNet - Scala API

MXNet supports the Scala programming language. The MXNet Scala package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to Scala. It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Scala. It also lets you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Scala,
  and apply them to tasks, such as image classification and data science challenges.
