# Image Classification

This fold contains examples for image classifications. In this task, we assign
labels to an image with a confidence scores. For example ([source][1]):

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/image/image-classification.png
width=400/>

## How to use

- First build mxnet by following the [guide](http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build.html)
- [network](network/) contains various neural networks. Other directories,
  e.g.~[mnist](mnist/), contain programs to train models on a particular
  dataset. e.g.

  ```bash
  cd mnist; python train_lenet.py
  ```

- pre-trained models are also provided.
